# Quaternion_Skining

Written by: Reut Shmuel

Based on the engine of my lecturer Tamir Grossinger: https://github.com/tamirgrBGU/EngineVideoGames

Implementation in openGL.

Creates a snake using a Cubic Bezier from my "Cubic_Bezier" - a head, a tail and 3 cylinders for the body.

Implementation of skinning using Dual Quaternions.

Right and left arrows – rotates picked link around the previous link Z axis (the first link will rotate around the scene z axis).

Up and down arrows – rotates picked link around the current X axis (using Euler angles).

'c' enters or exits camera mode - in camera mode the arrows rotates the camera around the origin of the scene.

'a' and 'z' keys - zoom in/out.
